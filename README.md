# Data Visualization Project - 10 Visualizations About Surviving Graduate School

# Description

The following is a series of visualizations detailing my experience as part of the first cohort of the Master of Data Science — Computational Linguistics program at UBC (2019–2020). These visualizations were created to answer questions that I had coming into this unique program. My hope is that future students will benefit from knowing what the program is like, or at least try to get prioritize their mental health during their studies.
